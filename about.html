<h2>Our Story</h2>
<div class= "content">
<p>We came up with this project so as to help the needy African children such as the orphans,the disabled and the malnourished.</p>
<p>It is quite a hard process because each and every time children are increasing in number but the resources are are scarce.<p>
<p>We faced alot of problems during lockdown,where by we had limited resources,the country was at lockdown and we even lost one child.He died of Covid'19</p>
<p>The project begun on <u>31st JUly,2019.</p></u>
<p>But fully registered in 2022</p>
<p>Founded by Norman and Julian who are students of Makerere University</p>
